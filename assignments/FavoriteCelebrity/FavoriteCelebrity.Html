            <h2> My Favorite Song</h2>
            <p>My favorite song of Adele is <b>"Set Fire to the Rain".</b></p>
            <p>No proper music video was shot for "Set Fire to the Rain" (as well as other singles from 21, "Rumour Has
                It" and "Turning Tables") as Adele had recently undergone vocal surgery.</p>
            <p>Instead, a live performance video filmed at The Royal Albert Hall was uploaded on YouTube to her Vevo
                account and has received more than 789 million views as of December 2023.</p>
